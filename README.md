# BMI Calculator

This is a simple Java program that calculates BMI (Body Mass Index) based on user-provided height and weight. It provides a BMI category based on the calculated value.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.

2. Enter your height and weight when prompted. Make sure to provide positive values for both height and weight, as BMI cannot be calculated with zero or negative values.

3. The program will calculate your BMI and display your BMI category, such as "UnderWeight," "Normal Weight," "Over Weight," etc.

4. If you enter invalid values (zero or negative) for height or weight, the program will display an error message.

## BMI Categories

- BMI < 16: Serious underweight
- 16 <= BMI < 18: Underweight
- 18 <= BMI < 24: Normal weight
- 24 <= BMI < 29: Overweight
- 29 <= BMI < 35: Serious overweight
- BMI >= 35: Obesity
